# Mercury Cyber Documenter Plugin

** Copyright 2023, Mercury Cyber, LLC **

## Background

The Mercury Cyber documenter is an original creation to provide automated documentation.

Currently it provides the ability to generate a spreadsheet based on the ObjectConfig-Identity data.
This functionality recreates a traditional Identity Attribute spreadsheet and applications can be 
excluded from the analysis.

It also includes a role analysis task that is used to list roles in order of hierarchy.
When the role analysis is used in bottomup mode, it can be edited into a script to delete roles
in the IdentityIQ Console.
